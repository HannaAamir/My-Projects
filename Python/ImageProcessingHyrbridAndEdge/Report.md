**Part A: Edge Detection Results**

The smoothing successfully reduced noise and smoothes out minor variations in the intensity of the pixels, which made it easier to do the edge detection process. The gradient computation makes vertically aligned and horizontally aligned objects more emphaiszed. The gradient magnitude represented edges as as bright regions against a darker background. Overall, the results showed edges which formed a clear outline of objects in the image, accurately reflecting areas of significant intensity transition. The gradual intensity change resulted in smooth transitions and abrupt changes resulted in sharp transitions. 

**Part B: Hybrid Image Creation Results**

The low pass filter successfully blurred the the high frequency details, leaving a smoothed, less detailed version. Additionally, increasing the cut off frequency reuslted in a clearer low pass image with preserved details, while lower cutoff frequencies caused more prominent blurring.

Additionally, the high pass filter on image c retained only the high frequncy details such as sharp edges and textures, resembling image d. During experimentations, higher cutoff freuqnecies kept fine details, while lower frequencies emphasized broader edges. The hyrbrid image results varied based on the distance of perception. At closer viewing distance, the hybrid image from C dominated it, showing a sharp, detailed view. At further distances, the low frequency content from Image A became prominent.
