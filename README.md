# My-Projects
Hi! My name is Hanna Aamir. Welcome to my repository of my coding projects. I have learned so much from making these and I am excited to share these with you.

I am currently busy completeing junior year in my B.S in Computer Science @ CU Denver - but you can be sure that more projects are on the way!
