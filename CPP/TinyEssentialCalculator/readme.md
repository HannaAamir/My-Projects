## Description of the program 

1. 
2. 
3. It is a tiny calculator which computes five particular operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo). In addition, the calculator keeps track of the running total, the average of all operations, the total number of operations, and the number of operations for each type (eg.. addition).
4. The primary logic consist of a class (ie. TinyCalculator), which contains several member variables and functions to perform and keep track of all calculations for one object instantiaton of the class.
5. The main/driver program prompts the user and computes and displays the calculations and results using the TinyCalculator.cpp and TinyCalculator.hpp.


##  Source files
- ***main.cpp***
  Main program.  This is the driver program that uses the TinyCalculator class to compute, keep track of, and display all operations entered by the user.

- ***TinyCalculator.cpp***
  This file contains all the class' (TinyCalculator) implementations for it's member variables, functions, constructor and enum operation type. 
  
- ***TinyCalculator.hpp***
  This file contains the entire prototype/class interface for TinyCalculator.

***output.txt***
  Contains the output of the driver program in a native text file.
