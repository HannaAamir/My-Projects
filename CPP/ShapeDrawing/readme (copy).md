## Description of the program 

1. The program requires no user interaction.
2. There are five functions used to draw different shapes (ie. circle, square, triangle, rectangle) to the console. Additionally, two of the functions compute the area and perimeter of each shape.
3. Each function contains parameters which are either initialized in main() and/or are set to a default value in "functions.hpp".
4. The main/driver program displays the shapes that have been drawn to the console, in addition to the area and perimeter of each shape and all the shapes combined, by invoking function calls and including "functions.cpp".


##  Source files
- ***main.cpp***
  Main program.  This is the driver program that uses multiple functions and error handling to draw and output shapes to the screen. Additionally, this program also computes the area and perimeter of each shape and all shapes combined in total.

***functions.cpp***
  This file contains all the function definitions used by the driver program. Additionally, it contains global variables such as the enum type for each shape and the pi math constant. Lastly, the default values for function paramaters are specified in this file.
  
***implementation.cpp***
  This file contains the implementations of each function and the global variables used in the functions.

***output.txt***
  Contains the output of the driver program in a native text file.
